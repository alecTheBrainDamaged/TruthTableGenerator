# *Truth Table Generator* 
This program has an Elm front end for a web app, and a Haskell back end. 
It is still being edited to add ->
> 1. Testing for backend and front end. 
> 2. Better UI for more attractiveness. 
> 3. More logical operators. 
## Tutorial 
You must compile Main.elm into a main.js file. 
I have not done it because I am still adding stuff to this project. 
Enter one or more propositions separated line by line , therefore symbol to seperate conclusion. 
You can also enter more than one conclusion, if you seperate them also line by line.
