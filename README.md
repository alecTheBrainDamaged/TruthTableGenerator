# *Truth Table Generator* 
This program has an Elm front end for a web app, and a Haskell back end. 
It is still being edited to add ->
> 1. Testing for backend and front end. 
> 2. Better UI for more attractiveness. 
> 3. More logical operators. 
## Tutorial 
Enter one or more propositions separated line by line , therefore symbol to seperate conclusion. 
You can also enter more than one conclusion, if you seperate them also line by line.

"Ask Yourself" the Youtuber, helped me with tool recomendations like packages, and languages to use
and made me interested in learning about logic especially propositional logic 
and Haskell and Elm. He is building a website soon so stay tune for that if you like 
logic, veganism, functional programming, philosophy, and debates.

AI helped me when I was stuck . 
But I learned how to do things with them.
