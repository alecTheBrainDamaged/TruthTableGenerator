# *Truth Table Generator* 
This program has an Elm front end for a web app, and a Haskell back end. 
It is still being edited and improved. 
To use this locally as the code is for the back end, 
you would have to install basically ghc , the haskell compiler, cabal-install, 
and elm compiler as far as I know.

I called the bottom "www.simplifyLogic.com" 
because if I decide to make a website with tools for logic, 
that would be a name I might pick. 

I did not put cells for the table but I can add it later.

### Acknowledgements
People including the Youtuber (Ask Yourself) 
helped me choose the tools to use . 
He inspired me to learn Propositional logic, and these functional
programming languages, Elm , and Haskell. 

Tools for front end. 
elm-ui package helped me.

For back end , this parser library helped me, especailly their tutorial. 
[Haskell Text.Megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec)
 
I defined colors for light and dark mode using this color style and set of colors.

This is the font I will be using which is why the css file is there.

AI helped me when I was stuck . 
But I learned how to do things with them.
