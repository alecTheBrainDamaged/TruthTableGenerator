"Ask Yourself" the Youtuber, helped me with tool recomendations like packages, and languages to use
and made me interested in learning about logic especially propositional logic 
and Haskell and Elm. He is building a website soon, stay tune for that if you like 
logic, veganism, functional programming, philosophy, and debates.
