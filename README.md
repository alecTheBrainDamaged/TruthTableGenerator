# *Truth Table Generator* 
This program has an Elm front end for a web app, and a Haskell back end. 
It is still being edited to add 
> 1. Testing for backend and front end. 
> 2. Better UI for more attractiveness. 
> 3. More logical operators.

### Acknowledgements
elm-ui package helped me.
[elm-ui](https://package.elm-lang.org/packages/mdgriffith/elm-ui/latest/)

For back end , this parser library helped me, especailly their tutorial. 
[Haskell Text.Megaparsec](https://hackage.haskell.org/package/megaparsec)

"Ask Yourself" the Youtuber, helped me with tool recomendations like packages, and languages to use
and made me interested in learning about logic especially propositional logic 
and Haskell and Elm. He is building a website soon, stay tune for that if you like 
logic, veganism, functional programming, philosophy, and debates.

AI helped me when I was stuck . 
But I learned how to do things with them.
